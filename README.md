# INTRODUCTION
This project explores using Chit Funds as a platform for credit score evaluation. It focuses on participants' behavior to create an alternative credit assessment method, especially for those without formal credit histories.

# THEORETICAL BASE 
## Chit Fund Mechanism
Chit funds operate on a set start date and duration, matching the number of participants. Members make regular contributions to a common pool. Each month, an auction takes place where members bid "reverse bids" for a lump sum, known as the "Prize Money." The member willing to forfeit the most future contributions to receive the money immediately wins. After a small management fee, the remaining pool is divided among all members. This process repeats monthly, allowing everyone to access a larger sum when needed. Essentially, chit funds are a way to borrow against future savings. Key Roles in a Chit Fund:
- Winning Bidder: The member who bids the lowest to get the "Prize Money" takes a short-term loan from the pool.
- Members: All members contribute monthly and receive dividends, reducing their future contributions. This acts as a savings plan.
- Organizer: The person managing the fund, overseeing auctions and distributions, earning a 5% commission.
## Elbow Method
Elbow Method is a simple way to decide how many groups (clusters) to divide your data into. Consider it as figuring out the right number of "buckets" to sort your customers based on similar behaviors, like shopping habits. It helps you avoid having too few groups, which might miss important details, or too many, which can be overwhelming.

## Silhouette
Silhouette is a method for evaluating the quality of clusters in a dataset. It assesses how well data points fit within their assigned group (cluster) and how distinct these groups are from one another. In business, this is particularly useful for determining whether segmentation—such as grouping customers based on behavior—is meaningful and effective.

## K-Means Algorithm
K-Means Clustering is a widely used unsupervised learning algorithm for grouping data points into clusters based on similarity. The algorithm works by:
1. Placing initial "centroids" (representative centers) for each cluster.
2. Assigning data points to the nearest centroid based on their distance.
3. Iteratively adjust the centroids until the intra-cluster distances are minimized.

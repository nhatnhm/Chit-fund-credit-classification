# INTRODUCTION
This project explores using Chit Funds as a platform for credit score evaluation. It focuses on participants' behavior to create an alternative credit assessment method, especially for those without formal credit histories.

# THEORETICAL BASE 
Chit funds operate on a set start date and duration, matching the number of participants. Members make regular contributions to a common pool. Each month, an auction takes place where members bid "reverse bids" for a lump sum, known as the "Prize Money." The member willing to forfeit the most future contributions to receive the money immediately wins. After a small management fee, the remaining pool is divided among all members. This process repeats monthly, allowing everyone to access a larger sum when needed. Essentially, chit funds are a way to borrow against future savings. Key Roles in a Chit Fund:
- Winning Bidder: The member who bids the lowest to get the "Prize Money" takes a short-term loan from the pool.
- Members: All members contribute monthly and receive dividends, reducing their future contributions. This acts as a savings plan.
- Organizer: The person managing the fund, overseeing auctions and distributions, earning a 5% commission.
